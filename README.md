# Bitcoin-Future-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

This project investigates predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques and historical Bitcoin-GBP data. The study identifies four predictive models – MLP, LSTM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine – and selects the top two performers, MLP and Random Forest, for future price predictions. While these models demonstrate promising results, limitations include overfitting, data sensitivity, and overestimation.
